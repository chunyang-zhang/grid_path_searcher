# grid_path_searcher

This is a toy project for collecting/developing some fundamental algorithms of robotic motion planning based on the grid map. Algorithms in this repo are mainly implemented from scratch or integrated from other open-sourced repo. I will keep refine the code and add more algorithms incrementally.

Now this repo contains:

**Dijkstra & A**

**Jump Point Search**

*Some code for the Jump Point Search (JPS) are now integrated from [Sikang](https://github.com/KumarRobotics/jps3d)*
